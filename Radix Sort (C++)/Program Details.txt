Part 1: Implementation
----------------------
(i) Least Significant Digit (LSD)
(ii) Most Significant Digits (MSD)

Part 2: Analyzing the Complexity
--------------------------------
We generate 100 numbers randomly, count the number of key operations of Radix Sort (LSD),
and then generate 200 numbers, count the number of key operations and so on up to 1000 numbers.
We repeat for Radix Sort (MSD). The complexity of an algorithm is evaluated using key operations.
