Part 1: Implementation
(i) FIFO  
(ii) LRU
(iii) Optimal page
 
Part 2: Analyzing the Performance
Assuming number of frames is 3 and length of reference string is 20.
We show the content of these page frames at different page numbers in the reference string
and compute the total number of page faults for each of the three page replacement algorithms.
